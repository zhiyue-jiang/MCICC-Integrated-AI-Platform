# Biomni: A General-Purpose Biomedical AI Agent

## Overview


Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide range of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. By integrating cutting-edge large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, Biomni helps scientists dramatically enhance research productivity and generate testable hypotheses.


## Quick Start

### Installation

Our software environment is massive and we provide a single setup.sh script to setup.
Follow this [file](biomni_env/README.md) to setup the env first.

Then activate the environment E1:

```bash
conda activate biomni_e1
```

then install the biomni official pip package:

```bash
pip install biomni --upgrade
```

For the latest update, install from the github source version, or do:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni.git@main
```

Lastly, configure your API keys using one of the following methods:

#### Option 1: Using .env file (Recommended)

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your actual API keys
```

Your `.env` file should look like:

```env
# Required: Anthropic API Key for Claude models
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Optional: OpenAI API Key (if using OpenAI models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Azure OpenAI API Key (if using Azure OpenAI models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/

# Optional: AI Studio Gemini API Key (if using Gemini models)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: groq API Key (if using groq as model provider)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Optional: Set the source of your LLM for example:
#"OpenAI", "AzureOpenAI", "Anthropic", "Ollama", "Gemini", "Bedrock", "Groq", "Custom"
LLM_SOURCE=your_LLM_source_here

# Optional: AWS Bedrock Configuration (if using AWS Bedrock models)
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=your_bedrock_api_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Optional: Custom model serving configuration
# CUSTOM_MODEL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
# CUSTOM_MODEL_API_KEY=your_custom_api_key_here

# Optional: Biomni data path (defaults to ./data)
# BIOMNI_DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/data

# Optional: Timeout settings (defaults to 600 seconds)
# BIOMNI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
```

#### Option 2: Using shell environment variables

Alternatively, configure your API keys in bash profile `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # optional if you just use Claude
export OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/" # optional unless you are using Azure
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="YOUR_BEDROCK_API_KEY" # optional for AWS Bedrock models
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1" # optional, defaults to us-east-1 for Bedrock
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" #optional if you want to use a gemini model
export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY" # Optional: set this to use models served by Groq
export LLM_SOURCE="Groq" # Optional: set this to use models served by Groq


```
</details>


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Package Conflicts

Some Python packages are not installed by default in the Biomni environment due to dependency conflicts. If you need these features, you must install the packages manually and may need to uncomment relevant code in the codebase. See the up-to-date list and details in [docs/known_conflicts.md](./docs/known_conflicts.md).

### Basic Usage

Once inside the environment, you can start using Biomni:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize the agent with data path, Data lake will be automatically downloaded on first run (~11GB)
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Execute biomedical tasks using natural language
agent.go("Plan a CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion, generate 32 genes that maximize the perturbation effect.")
agent.go("Perform scRNA-seq annotation at [PATH] and generate meaningful hypothesis")
agent.go("Predict ADMET properties for this compound: CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O")
```
If you plan on using Azure for your model, always prefix the model name with azure- (e.g. llm='azure-gpt-4o').

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

Biomni supports MCP servers for external tool integration:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

agent = A1()
agent.add_mcp(config_path="./mcp_config.yaml")
agent.go("Find FDA active ingredient information for ibuprofen")
```


**Built-in MCP Servers:**
For usage and implementation details, see the [MCP Integration Documentation](docs/mcp_integration.md) and examples in [`tutorials/examples/add_mcp_server/`](tutorials/examples/add_mcp_server/) and [`tutorials/examples/expose_biomni_server/`](tutorials/examples/expose_biomni_server/).
