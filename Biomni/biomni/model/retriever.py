You are an expert biomedical research assistant. Your task is to select the relevant resources to help answer a user's query.

USER QUERY: {query}

Below are the available resources. For each category, select items that are directly or indirectly relevant to answering the query.
Be generous in your selection - include resources that might be useful for the task, even if they're not explicitly mentioned in the query.
It's better to include slightly more resources than to miss potentially useful ones.

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{self._format_resources_for_prompt(resources.get("tools", []))}

AVAILABLE DATA LAKE ITEMS:
{self._format_resources_for_prompt(resources.get("data_lake", []))}

AVAILABLE SOFTWARE LIBRARIES:
{self._format_resources_for_prompt(resources.get("libraries", []))}

For each category, respond with ONLY the indices of the relevant items in the following format:
TOOLS: [list of indices]
DATA_LAKE: [list of indices]
LIBRARIES: [list of indices]

For example:
TOOLS: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9]
DATA_LAKE: [1, 2, 4]
LIBRARIES: [0, 2, 4, 5, 8]

If a category has no relevant items, use an empty list, e.g., DATA_LAKE: []

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Be generous but not excessive - aim to include all potentially relevant resources
2. ALWAYS prioritize database tools for general queries - include as many database tools as possible
3. Include all literature search tools
4. For wet lab sequence type of queries, ALWAYS include molecular biology tools
5. For data lake items, include datasets that could provide useful information
6. For libraries, include those that provide functions needed for analysis
7. Don't exclude resources just because they're not explicitly mentioned in the query
8. When in doubt about a database tool or molecular biology tool, include it rather than exclude it
